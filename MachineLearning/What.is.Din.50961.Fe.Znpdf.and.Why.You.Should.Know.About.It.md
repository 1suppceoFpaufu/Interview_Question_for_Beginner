Zinc coatings are widely used to protect iron or steel components from corrosion, especially in automotive, construction and industrial applications. Zinc coatings provide a sacrificial layer that prevents rusting of the base metal. Zinc coatings can also improve the appearance and functionality of the components.
  
However, not all zinc coatings are created equal. Depending on the service conditions, different zinc coating thicknesses and supplementary treatments may be required to achieve the desired corrosion resistance and performance. This is where Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf comes in handy.
  
## What Does Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf Cover?
  
Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf is a standard that supplements the provisions of DIN EN ISO 2081, which specifies the general requirements for electroplated zinc coatings with supplementary treatments on iron or steel. Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf specifies, for various service conditions, the minimum requirements regarding corrosion resistance when the coatings are tested using a DIN 50018 KFW 2.0 S test, as well as recommending coating thicknesses.
  
Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf also specifies the requirements for corrosion resistance for zinc coatings that have not been subsequently treated, such as chromated or passivated. These requirements are based on either the DIN 50018 KFW 2.0 S test or the neutral salt spray test (NSS) as in DIN EN ISO 9227.
  
Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf defines four types of zinc coating thicknesses: 5, 8, 12 and 25 micrometers. The thicker the coating, the higher the corrosion resistance. However, other factors such as the type of supplementary treatment, the base metal composition and the environmental conditions may also affect the corrosion resistance of zinc coatings.
  
## Why Should You Use Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf?
  
Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf is a useful standard for anyone who needs to specify or evaluate electroplated zinc coatings on iron or steel components. By using Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf, you can ensure that you are getting a quality zinc coating that meets your expectations and requirements.
  
Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf can help you to:
 
- Select the appropriate zinc coating thickness and supplementary treatment for your application.
- Verify the corrosion resistance of zinc coatings by using standardized tests.
- Compare different zinc coating options and suppliers.
- Comply with relevant regulations and directives regarding chrome-VI free passivation of zinc coatings.

Din 50961 Fe Zn.pdf is available online from various sources such as GlobalSpec[^1^], Midtjydsk Fornikling[^2^] and Scribd[^3^]. You can download it as a PDF file and use it as a reference for your electroplated zinc coating projects.
